                  Technology is growing at breakneck speed and has changed the
                  way people act, how they perceive, and how they live.
                  Organisations are also trying to keep pace with emerging
                  technology, and the entire landscape is getting more
                  provocative and aggressive. 
                  <p> The most sought-after and evident
                    commercial technology today is enterprise software solutions
                    which help businesses to be more focused and fast-paced. The
                    use of enterprise apps helps employees to control the
                    organisation’s resources along with different unforeseen
                    events while establishing effective communication within and
                    outside the company.</p> 
                    <p> Well-conceived and functionally profound
                        enterprise apps also help in the processing of complex tasks,
                        decision making, and efficient reporting in the organisation.
                        Businesses that use enterprise software applications keep pace
                        with advanced technology and are not left in the dust by their
                        competitors. However, research has shown that approximately
                  78% of enterprise applications are abandoned after their first
                  use. What could be responsible for this?</p> 
                  <p>Most enterprise apps — which in most cases are poorly designed — are virtually
                    forced down the throats of employees since they are mostly
                    used in organisations. Enterprise apps are not social or
                    consumer apps which are exclusively designed to keep users
                    engrossed and interested for as long as possible. It is even
                    believed that over 80% of existing enterprise applications
                    will fail as a result of: </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>lack of user involvement </li>
                        <li>boring interfaces </li>
                        <li>failure to innovate and keep with new technology </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Some enterprise apps are painful, and employees will rather use manual, 
                        time-consuming workarounds instead of spending the time to familiarise themselves with the tools. </p>
                </p>
                <p>Perhaps this is why some employees and teams who work in organizations with flexible work ethics prefer to choose and use apps that they love as against using software that was forced on them by the organisation they work for.</p>

                <p>This implies that UX designers who create enterprise apps should start focusing on how to apply consumer thinking to enterprise product design to facilitate workflow within organizations. It is bad enough that CIOs prefer function over user-friendliness which has resulted in less 
                    adoption of enterprise software and — by extension — the profit margin of the application.</p>

                    <p>Consumer apps have enjoyed a great deal of usage over the past few years because most of them appeal to people who purchase and use them extensively on a daily basis. The user-friendliness and simplicity of consumer applications hold the attention of users for extended periods, and if enterprise apps can copy this feat, then there will be a significant improvement in the use of these software solutions in the business world.

                            For increased productivity and user experience, therefore, UX designers should do the following when it comes to developing enterprise applications:</p>

                            <h1>1. Research How People Work, In Their Places Of Work</h1>

                            <p>Conducting adequate research before designing enterprise software should be paramount in the minds of UX designs. This is because an in-depth analysis can help UX designers discover the following:</p>

                            <h1>2. Study To Implement An Appropriate Balance Between Beginner and Expert Users</h1>
                            <p>Enterprise applications have few users that fit in the “expert” category as a result of constant and daily usage of the apps.</p>

                                 <p> </p>   However, the same cannot be said about novices who tend to shy away from complex interactions. Therefore, UX designers should focus on presenting simple and clear journeys for first-time users so that they can execute tasks within a short time. The more complex interfaces can be left for experts to use.</p>
                                 <h1>3. Collect And Respond to User Feedback</h1>
                                 <p>It is crucial for developers of enterprise apps to keep collecting and responding to user feedback as it helps to keep them on their toes while making necessary changes to enhance user experience.</p>
                                 <p>For instance, tedious tasks that users need to use repeatedly on a daily or hourly basis can be automated.</p>
                                 <p>Additional functionalities can also be integrated to facilitate rapid sifting of the growing data that is managed by the applications.</p>
                                 <h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>There is no doubt that if the measures mentioned above are put in place, UX will increase the cost of enterprise software development. However, the profit and benefits of user-friendly programs will exceed expenditure. Since these apps produce solutions that meet the specific needs and desires of users, more people will use them, and organisations will benefit significantly in the long run.</p>
