                                The supply chain is one of the oldest, biggest markets in
                                the world. At the same time, it’s less explored space by new
                                technologies. This leaves it vulnerable to be inundated with
                                outdated systems. The systems are not useful, and even bring
                                painful experiences for its users. This was my initial
                                experience when I tried to find a solution for managing
                                freelancers I connect with remotely. As part of the design
                                process, I initiated and launched a sprint: using primary
                                data from interviews of industry experts, to be able to
                                understand the problem in more detail.

                                I followed a user Centred approach. This user-centred approach
                                led me to interview and interact with a range of professional
                                within the contingency management industry. Their skill sets
                                range from technical consultant, developers, and talent
                                acquisition managers.

                            <h2>Lack of collaboration </h2>
                            <p>Out of the the total 8 industry experts I interviewed to
                                understand the overall problem and how they currently solve
                                them, I shortlisted 4 industry experts that matched my
                                criteria to dig deep with more information. These
                                professionals share one problem . 85% of the interviewed
                                individuals use a manual process to manage their freelancers.
                                i.e spreadsheets and e-mails outside of the initial app that
                                connected them. i.e Upwork, Dribbble, Behance etc. These
                                places have their own simple collaboration tools, however, if
                                you have different freelancers from a different number of
                                platforms it becomes a nightmare, not only jumping from one
                                platform to another but also remembering the freelancers they
                                aggregated from these for future collaboration. In addition,
                                if another colleague wants to hire a freelancer that was hired
                                by another colleague, they would have to share spreadsheets,
                                and e-mails and different tools in order to find an already
                                on-boarded freelancer.</p>

                                the lack
                                of immersive collaboration that mimic the fill the gap between real world collaboration

                                <p> Applied the following principles to my design:

                                    <h6> 1. Law of Common Region</h6>
                                    <h6> 2. Law of Proximity</h6>
                                    <h6>3. Law of Uniform Connectedness</h6>




                                    <p>These principles were combined with the user research, competitive analysis, in
                                        which I used Nielsen Norman Group’s Usability Heuristics ,
                                        combined with the above design principles *led a strong foundation for the start

                                    I wanted to include the 5 most important things that projects managers need to view
                                    and applied the F and Z reading patterns to provide a simple overview.
                                    <p>The hierarchy provides a great role in the information architecture of this
                                        dashboard. *Showing the most relevant tasks and content at the top of the page
                                        was crucial so that boat owners could see their service tasks and status at a
                                        glance.* </p>
                                    <p>I choose to use an operational dashboard using cards for this redesign to show
                                        the users what status their project is in, as well as color coded for easy
                                        checking at a glance. </p>
                                    <p>The dashboard has been structured so that the most important data is visible
                                        within the card using different font weight and size helping the user get a
                                        snapshot as soon as they open the dashboard.</p>

                            <p>Before focusing on creating the UI, I needed to focus on the style and patterns for the
                                new branding. </p>

                            <p>This design system is based on atomic design principles. The system consists of a grid,
                                typography, colors, navigation, and information architecture. *The design system was
                                proven to be a key element in streamlining the design and development process, providing
                                a single source of truth and consistency throughout the life of the product.*</p>

            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <h4>Based on the interviews and researches, we have located and created a foundational pattern to build this
                project further. There is a real dire problem to work through further on, especially as the remote work
                is becoming accepted and valued. User-friendly systems will play a huge role. </h4>
               
            <h1>Key Lessons and Learnings</h1>
            <br><br><br>
            <h3>Do more of these. </h3>
            <h4>Expand on more Research x 3</h4>
            <h4>More in depth research</h4>

            <h4>Design Direction</h4>
            <br><br><br>
            <h3>Be Fast and Fluid</h3>
            <h4>Use a system for visual design
                Apply a design system such as Material Design for prototypes, as much I love Colorable for choosing my
                different shades.</h4>
            <br><br><br>
            <h3>Validate Assumption quickly and Incorporate Feedbacks</h3>
            <h4>I quickly discovered new pain points from the research by talking to industry experts. Other types of
                research i.e User testing of the final prototypes will show a more in-depth analysis of of the needs and
                current satisfaction of the users would be fantastic way to go forward. </h4>
            <h4>
                I love feedback because I understand feedbacks are bread and butter of a business's existence. I have to
                build up that mentality of listening to the user. </h4>
            <br><br><br>
            <h3>Work on my Protyping skills</h3>
            <h4>I currently use Figma as a prototyping tool and It does a good job, however, I have a plan to get into
                Framer as my an additional alternative prototyping tool. I am also currently learning React to ship
                ideas much faster and make the design transition much smoother and to enable me to work with engineers
                more collaboratively.</h4>
