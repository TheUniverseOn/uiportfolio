                        The supply chain is one of the oldest, biggest markets in the world. At the same time, it’s less
                        explored space by new technologies. This leaves it vulnerable to be inundated with outdated
                        systems. The systems are not useful, and even bring painful experiences for its users. This was
                        my initial experience when I tried to find a solution for managing freelancers I connect with

                        from interviews of industry experts, to be able to understand the problem in more detail.

                     <p>
                        When starting an exciting project like this one, it can be excruciating not open my design
                        software and start generating concepts. I have been on this path before where I get into deep
                        details at the early stage. Over time, I have to realise that I need to restrain myself from
                        that. because once I started with the foundation being high fidelity exprience it pollutes my
                        judgment and also most importantly the way users engage with you. It's best to keep simple, and
                        talk to people about their problems and workarounds naturally.

                     </p>
                     <p> Therefore, prior to getting ahead of myself, I need to make sure I get down to the details of
                        the user's life currently by asking them questions.

                           <li>+What type of workarounds have they created to help them with the problems i.e tools and

                     <h2> Testing the waters with manufacturing startup. </h2>
                     <p>
                        The project started with a research and interview with manufacturing focused tech company,
                        called Majik. This was the first interview conducted with a supply chain company that I thought
                        would be the potential target user for my research, however,
                        after a series of questions and learning what they do, I found out they are not the user who
                        deal with RFPs(Request for proposals).
                     </p>
                     <p>Despite the interview not being with the right user base, I learnt about the whole deal of
                        matters. As someone who is new to this market and sets of products, the descusion was fruitful
                        and there were a lot of questions
                        and hypothesis that came out of this interview.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheless, I need to be resourceful and find the right target group of users.</p>

                           <li>* Currently companies largely use emails or other tools to:</li>
                          * Create an RFP and send it internally for review
                           * Send out RFPs to suppliers for projects and receive responses from suppliers.</li>
                           <li>* These companies use multiple modes of communication at times such as IMs, docs, etc.
                              that are not in a central platform </li>

                           <li>*  </li>
                           <li>* Companies also hire RFP writers and agencies, RFP writers mostly use Word document to author their RFPs</li>
                           <li>* They are hired because it's complex to deal with proposal</li>
                           <li>* Procurement managers budget and are told to minimize spend and they have communicate value</li>
                           <li>* What exactly is the complex part for their RFP folks?</li>
                           <li>* It's not centralized - no place to bring all the people and proposals in one place</li>
                           <li>* They have to make sure to not go over their budget and </li>
                           <li>* They can't easily show how much $ they saved to their CTOs. etc → feature</li>
                           <li>* Target customers - the RFP or procurement people</li>
                           <li>* Main Hypothesis: They don't have a centralized system. What problems does this cost
                           </li>
                           <li>* You can't go question by question and compare responses</li>

                           <li>* You want to easily know who has responded and has not</li>

                     <h2>Found my target user group </h2>
                     <p> B2B user research harder than B2C, especially supply chain market.
                        I quickly learned that the user base is niche within the supply chain and procurement market.
                        The user base was, in fact, Sourcing managers who were responsible for managing RFPs within a
                        company.
                        This was a huge relief, and now comes understanding them in depth.

                  <br>
                  <h3>Formula: Importance - current satisfaction = opportunity </h3>
                  <p>
                     Staying focused on the user, I started with creating a Job story that's based on the Jobs To Be
                     Done framework.
                     I started with a list of features and rated the user's desired outcome. The rating is based on how
                     important they are satisfied the users are with the current solutions they have. </p>
                  <p>This is one of my favourite framework because It helps see were the real value is and also features
                     that are not useful for the user, I shouldn't focus on now.
                     <p>This is a lighter formula from the Lean Product Playbooks's Importance vs. Satisfaction matrix,
                        the Gap Analysis and Jobs To Be Done opportunity score calculation into this formula.</p>
                     <p>As you can see from the score, the opportunity scores are mostly high on each feature. Most of
                        the users I have interviewed are not satisfied with the overall solutions they currently have.
                     </p>
                     <p>Payment and Invoices have a low opportunity score[score: 1] because the user would use other
                        payment focused platforms to facilitate those needs. </p>
                  </p>
                  <div class="feature-img">
                     <img class="img-fluid" src="img/procurement/featurelist.png" alt="">

                  </div>

                  <h1> Design </h1>
                  <p> </p>
                  <div class="feature-img">
                     <p> Applied the following principles to my design:

                        <h6> 1. Law of Common Region</h6>
                        <h6> 2. Law of Proximity</h6>
                        <h6>3. Law of Uniform Connectedness</h6>




                        <p>I wanted the user to have a less cognitive load when it comes to running the product, so I
                           followed the modular design approach so the user can focus on the project. An example can be
                           seen in the wireframe below where the procurement manager can see the lists of suppliers
                           invited, interested("RSVP")m submitted proposals and their progress is displayed within a
                           card, all in one view. This saves the user a lot of time and updates them the progress of
                           their project in seconds.
