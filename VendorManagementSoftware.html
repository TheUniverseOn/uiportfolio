                        The supply chain is one of the oldest, biggest markets in
                    the world. At the same time, it’s less explored space by new
                    technologies. This leaves it vulnerable to be inundated with
                    outdated systems. The systems are not useful, and even bring
                    painful experiences for its users. This was my initial
                    experience when I tried to find a solution for managing
                    freelancers I connect with remotely. As part of the design
                    process, I initiated and launched a sprint: using primary
                    data from interviews of industry experts, to be able to
                    understand the problem in more detail.

                <br><h1>User research</h1>
                     <p>
                           I followed a user Centred approach. This user-centred approach
                           led me to interview and interact with a range of professional
                           within the contingency management industry. Their skill sets
                           range from technical consultant, developers, and talent
                           acquisition managers.
                        
                     </p>
                     <br>     <h2>Lack of collaboration  </h2> 
                     <p>Out of the the total 8 industry experts I interviewed to
                           understand the overall problem and how they currently solve
                           them, I shortlisted 4 industry experts that matched my
                           criteria to dig deep with more information. These
                           professionals share one problem . 85% of the interviewed
                           individuals use a manual process to manage their freelancers.
                           i.e spreadsheets and e-mails outside of the initial app that
                           connected them. i.e Upwork, Dribbble, Behance etc. These
                           places have their own simple collaboration tools, however, if
                           you have different freelancers from a different number of
                           platforms it becomes a nightmare, not only jumping from one
                           platform to another but also remembering the freelancers they
                           aggregated from these for future collaboration. In addition,
                           if another colleague wants to hire a freelancer that was hired
                           by another colleague, they would have to share spreadsheets,
                           and e-mails and different tools in order to find an already
                           on-boarded freelancer.</p>
